Fast and Slow Pointers Approach: Intuition and Thought Process
Intuition
The Fast and Slow Pointers approach, also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, 
is a technique used to detect cycles in data structures like linked lists or arrays. The idea is to use two pointers that move at different speeds (typically, one moves twice as fast as the other). If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer within the cycle. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the structure.

Thought Process
Initialization: Start with two pointers, both pointing to the beginning of the data structure.
Movement:
The slow pointer moves one step at a time.
The fast pointer moves two steps at a time.

Cycle Detection:
If the fast pointer meets the slow pointer, a cycle exists.
If the fast pointer reaches the end (null), there is no cycle.

Cycle Start (Optional):
To find the start of the cycle, reset one of the pointers to the beginning and move both pointers one step at a time until they meet. The meeting point is the start of the cycle.

When to Use
Detecting cycles in linked lists.
Detecting cycles in arrays (e.g., repeated elements).
Finding the middle of a linked list.
