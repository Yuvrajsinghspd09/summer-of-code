Time Complexity: 
O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. The array is traversed once.
Space Complexity: 
O(1). Only a constant amount of extra space is used.

Time Complexity: 

O(n), where ùëõ
n is the number of elements in the array. We traverse the array once to populate the dictionary and once more to find the single number.
Space Complexity: 
O(n) in the worst case if all elements are distinct and stored in the dictionary.
