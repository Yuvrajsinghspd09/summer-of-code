Tips and Tricks for LeetCode Questions:
a. Two-Pointer Technique:

Fast and slow pointers (Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm)
Use cases: Detecting cycles, finding middle element, finding nth node from the end

b. Dummy Node:

Create a dummy node at the start of the list
Useful for operations that might change the head of the list

c. Reverse a Linked List:

An essential operation that comes up often
Can be done iteratively or recursively

d. Merge Two Sorted Lists:

A fundamental operation for many problems
Use a dummy node and iterate through both lists

e. Recursive Approaches:

Many linked list problems can be solved recursively
Think about the base case and how to break down the problem
