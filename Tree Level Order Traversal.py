'''
Time Complexity: The time complexity of this approach is 
O(n), where ùëõ
n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed once, and for each node, constant-time operations are performed.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is also 
O(n) in the worst case, where all nodes are stored in the queue simultaneously during the traversal.
